# Deep-Learning-in-medical-field
 A Deep learning course provided by faculty of engineering Cairo university to 4rd grade students of the Biomedical & software department

## Note
- this repository contains the course assignments and projects
- the final project is a medical image segmentation project using U-net architecture and transfer learning [here](https://github.com/mohammed-444/GI-Tract-Image-Segmentation)
- this course is the follow up of the [Machine Learning course](https://github.com/Andrew2077/AI_in_medical_fields)
- Datasets were not uploaded due to their size
